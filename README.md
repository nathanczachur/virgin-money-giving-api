Provides a PHP library for interacting with the Virgin Money Giving API.

This library will help with pushing and pulling data from the API. Unfortunately the API has quite a few undocumented quirks that this library hopes to stop developers falling into.

## Prerequisites 

### API Keys
To interact with the VGM API you will need to get API keys. To do this you'll need to register on the site (https://developer.virginmoneygiving.com/member/register).

You will need to create an application here on the Apps overview page: /apps/myapps.

Then on your keys overview page you can grab your API key: /apps/mykeys.

For some reason you will need different API keys for different API calls. The list can be found here:
